To use DVC for pipeline tracking, we need Git.
-	Download and install anaconda
-	In local directory, open gitbash with anaconda initialized
-	In the same local directory, open your code editor like VSC

In vsc, first step is to set up your virtual environment
-	To do that, in gitbash anaconda, conda create –n test python=3.11 –y (test here is the environment name. it’s up to you)
-	To activate the environment, conda activate test
-	To install dependencies and requirements, pip install –r requirements.txt (requirements.txt should be a file in your vsc with all your requirements packages listed such as scikit-learn, xgboost, nltk, pandas, numpy, dvc, PyYAML)
-	…
-	After we have created our pipeline, we create a file in vsc named dvc.yaml (a configuration file)
-	In the yaml file, we write the commands


DVC Commands: after we have written the commands in the yaml file, in the gitbash terminal
-	First step is to initialize git, git init
-	Then initialize the dvc, dvc init
-	This is the main file that runs the dvc.yaml file commands. dvc repro (this won’t run if it has already been run before and/or no new changes to the code base i.e. pipeline tracking). 
-	To show your pipeline, dvc dag
-	to show the metric outputs dvc metrics show
