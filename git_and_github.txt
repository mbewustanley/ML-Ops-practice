Local and remote repository setup:
-	After creating repo on github, click on code(green), HTTPS and copy the link
-	Open your local folder on your system as well as gitbash in that local folder
-	Then clone the github environment in your local folder on the gitbash terminal with git clone copied link
-	Use cd repo name/ to change directory to the folder you created


Code management with git:
-	Best practice for coding on your pc is to open your VSC files from the local git folder to initialize it to your git environment.
-	After creating a file or updating an old one, such changes exist only in your local environment. To move to github…
-	Open gitbash terminal, use git status to see newly added files to be committed and pushed.
-	To add, use git add filename, or git add . to add all unadded files
-	To commit, use git commit –m “your commit message”
-	To push to github, git push origin main (main is the name of the branch)
-	In the case where you want to pull files other developers have pushed, use git pull to update your code base


Branch management:
-	To check available branches, use git branch
-	To create a new branch, use git checkout –b branch name
-	To switch back to main branch, git checkout main
